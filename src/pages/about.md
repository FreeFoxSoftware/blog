Hi there and welcome to my blog!

I'm Scott and I'm a Software Engineer originally from the north of England but now living in the Netherlands.

This blog will be a place where you can find technical blogs probably around Kubernetes and the .NET world although it may drift into more random things

The only reason this blog actually exists is because I was interested in diving deeply in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and needed something to host on it.
So, as of today (2023-03-20), I have a cluster running with only this blog. Yes, I agree it's a little overkill but I'll add some more stuff as I go along.

</div>

That's basically all from me at this point so I hope you find some use out of reading what is on here!

Cheers
